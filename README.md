PeakyClothing
A website that obviously inspired by Peaky Blinders . 

It's like a e-commerce website but for clothes. 

This is my first ever website that is actually deployed in the internet using GitHub's free web hosting. 

This website was created using HTML/CSS and a lil bit of JS all front-end.  

Check the website using this link:
